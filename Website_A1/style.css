  <h2>As a student studying New Media & Digital Design and Marketing at Fordham University, Iâ€™m currently exploring the intersection of art and technology in my creative coding class. In this class I will constantly add to my public-facing portfolio site to showcase all of my work, combining my love for photography with my growing coding skills. I can't wait to grow onto this page throughout the duration of my class!
